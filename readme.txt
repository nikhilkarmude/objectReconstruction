In computer graphics, 3D models are required for rendering; in computer vision, 3D
models provide additional information that can be used to resolve ambiguities inherent in 2D images.
While there exist many different ways of generating 3D models, stereopsis is the simplest in that it does
not require substantial devices other than a camera. In addition, the principles in stereopsis can be used
in other situations (such as Kinect) and the accuracy of the reconstructed surfaces is sufficient for certain
applications (e.g., reconstructing Rome using photos on the web). Another aspect of this assignment is
to be able to generate good quality textured models from images in VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling
Language) format or another format of your choice.
